Book Info
----------

This book is hosted on GitHub Pages. It is written using the delightful Python Sphinx documentation 
tool. In addition, we use the Sphinx RTD Theme. 

You can checkout the book and build it yourself. This could be useful if you wish to help us 
correct bugs/errors by issuing a pull request. While we welcome pull requests, we ask that you make
sure your request can build successfully, especially if it requires changes to the book and any
of the accompanying repositories.

The source code for this book is at https://github.com/LoyolaChicagoBooks/operatingsystems.

Book Examples
--------------

Although we write most examples in 100% pure C code, there are occasions where we mix C and C++, 
especially if the C++ code does not get in the way of the systems pedagogy.  That said, we also 
have some examples in Go, Java, C#, Python, and Scala, since we are constantly trying to find a way to
apply high-level langauges and software engineering ideas to systems programming.  While the most 
promising we have found so far is Go, we don't think it is going to disrupt C/C++ for the foreseeable
future. Nevertheless, early testing has shown some good performance!
