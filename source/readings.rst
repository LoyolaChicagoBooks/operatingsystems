Conference Paper Readings
=========================

Important Note
--------------
This assignment is for students enrolled in COMP-410. If you are enrolled in COMP-374, you are welcome to complete this assignment, but you will not be graded on it.

Summary
-------
The goal of this assignment will be to read academic papers on various operating systems topics. As graduate students, it is important to be able to read and write technical and academic papers. An important part of this course is to, by learning about each of the components of an operating system, to be able to understand and evaluate other systems level work. These readings will provide this practice.

Tasks for this Assignment
-------------------------
 #. You will read three research papers as detailed below.
 #. For each paper you read you will do one of the following:
     - Write a 1.5 page paper (10 pt. font, single space). No more than 5 pages.
     - Prepare 10 slides and give a 10 minute presentation to the class. No more than 15 slides.
 #. The paper or presentation must contain the following
     - The definition of the research problem that the author is attempting to solve
     - An analysis of the related work that the author discussed
     - An explanation and your opinion of the author's work.
     - Citations
 #. The paper may be submitted as a PDF or Word document
 #. The presentation may be submitted as a PDF or Power-Point document.
 #. You must write at least one paper.
 #. You may give at most two presentations.
 #. You are welcome to do more than three papers, but you will only be graded on the first three.

Acceptable Papers for this Assignment
-------------------------------------
 #. Any paper published at a Usenix conference (https://www.usenix.org)
 #. Any paper that is primarily about a research operating system and has been published at an IEEE or ACM sponsored conference. Good examples of research operating systems are - Minix, XINU, L4-Fiasco, Singularity, Plan-9 / Inferno, Amoeba.
 #. Any paper about a filesystem implementation
 #. Any paper about a virtual memory manager
 #. Any paper about kernel architecture (monolithic, micro, exo-kernels, etcâ€¦)
 #. Any papers about window managers or shells
 #. Papers containing performance evaluations of any operating system facility.
 #. Theoretical papers on process/disk scheduling or page replacement policies.
 #. Any paper not from the above categories that is approved by the instructor.

Not Acceptable Papers (but still interesting to read!) for this Assignment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 #. Papers that are primarily about networking or networks.
 #. Papers that are primarily about network security (other security is okay).
 #. Papers that are primarily about hardware
 #. Papers not published through an IEEE or ACM sponsored conference (you'll see prominent logos on the conference websites).

Due Dates
---------
No due dates will be set at this time. If most students have not submitted at least one paper or given a presentation by the midterm exam, I will setup deadlines.

Submission
----------
You can submit your papers and presentations through your public source control repository that you will be setting up for project 1 and using for the other course projects. When the paper is ready, you can notify me so that I can grade it. Once a few students are ready for presentations, I will try to schedule several at the beginning or end of a lecture.
