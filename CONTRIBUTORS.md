George K. Thiruvathukal is Professor of Computer Science at Loyola University Chicago and serves is the lead
maintainer and editor-in-chief of the latest work.

Sarah Kaylor created many of the excellent examples and initial versions of these lecture notes.

Neil Klingensmith is an Assistant Professor of CS at Loyola University Chicago and has been helping to
expand into new areas!

Jack West is an undergraduate and graduate student at Loyola University Chicago who presently serves as a TA
for the course and has been helping to make various improvements and contribute new examples.

We welcome contributions via pull requests and will give attribution to those who help us.

Please note that the focus is on operating systems *concepts* and advanced systems programming. We are not
writing a text on operating systems implementation, although we do show some kernel examples from Linux and Minix
to make various pedagogical points. We (George and Neil) are hoping to teach an OS Implementation class someday!
But that's not within the current scope of this project.

Please direct any questions to gkt@cs.luc.edu.
