Syllabus
========


Synopsis
--------

Operating systems play a vital role in just about all of computing as we know it: personal computers, servers, network routers, smartphones, tablets, and embedded systems. The operating system can be thought of as an "unsung hero" of sorts. After all, it is the one piece of software whose whole purpose is to abstract away the details of the underlying hardware and peripherals so your programs just run as they should. Knowledge of modern operating systems is arguably more important than ever. In this course, we'll approach operating systems with an eye on the present but a strong respect for the tradition of operating systems.

This course will mix theory with practice. Early programming assignments will be done with C and C++. Later in the course we will have at least one C# based project. We will definitely write some low-level C/C++ code and Intel assembly. We will emphasize an active learning model with clear conceptual lectures followed by in-class work sessions aimed at reinforcing what has traditionally been a difficult subject for students to learn. Nevertheless, students enrolled in this class should plan on spending significant time outside of class to learn the material and complete the assignments.

Prerequisites
-------------
C programming background will be assumed. If you lack knowledge of it or decided to forget it, you'll have about a week to learn it. There will be a warm-up programming assignment aimed at helping you determine whether you have adequate programming background to complete this course.

COMP 264 (Systems Programming) and COMP 271 (Data Structures) are both required for COMP 374 (and COMP 410). Regarding data structures, you must know and understand how to work with lists, trees, and other connected structures, which includes the algorithms for working with these abstract types. For those coming from a Java-only background, you must know and understand the concept of pointers and memory management. If you don't, please make sure you learn these concepts within the first week of class.

Graduate students in particular are advised that COMP 271 or equivalent without COMP 264 is probably insufficient, especially for this offering of COMP 410.

Graduate students are also expected to do work above and beyond the undergraduate version. This is likely to include a research/survey paper on at least one operating system or an additional assignment to modify or add a new service to Minix or Linux. Details will follow.

Book/Materials
--------------
- Required:
	- Modern Operating Systems by Andrew Tanenbaum. ISBN: 978-0133591620 (There are a few versions of this book, be sure to get the one with this ISBN!)
- Recommended:
	- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (2nd Edition) by W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago
	- C Programming Language (2nd Edition) by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie


Required Hardware/Software
--------------------------
You need to have access to a personal computer or laptop running Windows, OS X, or Linux this term. You can use the lab machines but will find that the best experience will come from having a computer where you have full administrative rights. This is a real operating systems course, and learning a bit about system administration (for better or worse) is a part of doing business. You will want to have at least 2GB RAM on your computer to work comfortably.

Virtualization software. We have decided to go with VMware for this course. You can access VMware through the departments VMAP (VMware Academic Program). You may use other virtualization software at your discretion, but all course demonstrations and walk throughs will be done with VMware.

Course Requirements / Grade Breakdown - Undergraduate Students
--------------------------------------------------------------

- 3-4 programming assignments (30%)
- In-class and online discussion group participation (10%)
- 1 Quiz and 1 Final Exam (30%)
- 1 Final Project or Paper (30%)


Course Requirements / Grade Breakdown - Graduate Students
---------------------------------------------------------

- 3-4 programming assignments (25%)
- In-class and online discussion group participation (10%)
- 1 Quiz and 1 final exam (25%)
- 1 Final project or paper (25%)
- 3 Conference paper reading assignments and oral presentation or written summary of papers (15%)


Late Work Policy
----------------

- Work is due on the due date announced in class or as it appears in the assignment details.
- You may turn in work after it is due. For each week the work is late, one letter grade is deducted.


Exam Policy
-----------

- Expect to have an exam mid-semester
- Expect to have an exam at a time consistent with the university's final exam schedule.
- If you need to miss an exam, you are welcome to schedule a time with me to take the exam on a date / time before the exam date. Valid reasons include but are not limited to having too many exams scheduled on one day.
- If you need to miss the exam due to an emergency, you will be given an opportunity to take the exam at a later time. The emergency will need to be documented (such as with a doctor's note).
- Regardless of when you take an exam, it is strictly prohibited (and unethical) to discuss the exam with other students until they have taken it and received a grade. In addition, the university's college and graduate school academic integrity policies apply.


Attendance Policy
-----------------

- Attendance is expected for every lecture. Attendance is not taken.
- There will be some material on the exam that will only be covered in the lecture and/or slides and not available in the course text book.
- We will also discuss projects / homework in class.


Academic Honesty Policy
-----------------------

- The University Academic Integrity Policy (http://www.luc.edu/academics/catalog/undergrad/reg_academicintegrity.shtml) will be enforced.
- Discussing programming projects, difficulties, bugs, and general approaches is encouraged.
- Discussing the lecture material is encouraged.
- Sharing project implementation source files with other students is cheating.
- Accepting project implementation source files from another student is cheating.
- Making use of source code available on the internet or from open source software is encouraged. You must cite with in-line code comments!
- Assisting another student in debugging their project is encouraged.
- Posting a code fragment / snippet (not entire source files) to the discussion board is encouraged as a way to foster discussion.
- Asking questions about the academic honesty policy is encouraged.
