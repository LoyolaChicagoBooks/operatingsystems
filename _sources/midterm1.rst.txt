Midterm Exam Prep
=================

Introduction
------------

- Following are a set of questions that may or may not show up in a similar form on the midterm exam
- Feel free to discuss these on the Piazza site
- The midterm exam will be closed-book, closed-notes, closed-computer and held in class.

How to do well on the exam
--------------------------

- The exam will be in March. Spend a small amount of time each week answering the questions below. A smaller, but sustained effort will help you absorb the material better and keep stress to a minimum.
- Ask questions on Piazza! Share and discuss answers!
- Become comfortable with your project #1 code!

Questions
---------

#. How do monolithic-kernel operating systems and micro-kernel operating systems differ?

#. Describe the role of a modern operating system on a computer. What guarantees are given to programs?

#. List and describe the memory sections of a process.

#. What are the steps that the loader takes in loading and launching the program?

#. What are the steps the loader takes when loading a shared library (.so file)?

#. Describe what the fork() system call does. Why does the fork() call need to return two different values when used within what seems to be the same program?

#. What are some ways that a scheduler can make a system get the most possible work done? In other words, what can a scheduler do to achieve the best throughput?

#. What are some ways that a scheduler can make a system more responsive? In other words, what can a scheduler do to achieve the best latency?

#. How does a scheduler know if a process is interactive or I/O intensive? How does a scheduler know if a process is CPU intensive or non-interactive?

#. Give an example of a real-time scheduling scenario that is schedulable and one that is not. Show your math. (Make your life easy by drawing a timeline!)

#. Assuming one thread is executing the producer() function and one thread is executing the consumer() function, circle the lines that are the critical section.

::

	int queue[10];
	int queueSize = 0;

	void producer() {
	  int item = 0;
	  while(1) {
	    item += 1;
	    if(queueSize < 10) {
	       queue[queueSize] = item;
	       queueSize += 1;
	    }
	  }
	}

	void consumer() {
	   while(1) {
 	    if(queueSize > 0) {
 	       int item = queue[queueSize];
 	       queueSize -= 1;
  	      printf(“item: %d\n”, item);
  	   }
 	  }
	}


#. Use the following functions to answer the next three questions:



::

	void method1() {
		a.Lock();
		b.Lock();
		method3();
		b.Unlock();
		a.Unlock();
	}

	void method2() {
		c.Lock();
		c.Unlock();
	}

	void method3() {
		d.Lock();
		method2();
		d.Unlock();
	}

	void method4() {
		d.Lock()
		a.Lock()
		method2();
		a.Unlock();
		d.Unlock();
	}

#. Draw the lock graph for the functions (directed graph that shows possible lock orders)
#. Assuming method1() is called by thread #1 and method4() is called by thread #2, draw the traversal on the lock graph.
#. Identify any possible deadlock if it exists.
#. What capability, instruction, or function must the CPU provide for a spin lock to work that cannot be expressed in the C programming language?
#. Write the pseudo-code for the spin_lock() function that uses the CPU capability above. You can encapsulate that CPU capability into a function that you assume already exists.
#. Explain how muteness differ from semaphores. How would you emulate a mutex with a semaphore? How would it be initialized and how would it be used?
#. When is it appropriate to use an event semaphore? You may answer this question by giving an example or well-known example.
#. When is it appropriate to use a monitor rather than a mutex or a semaphore?
#. In pseudo code, show how to use a monitor.
#. When should the Pulse() operation on a monitor be used? Give an example.
#. When using monitors, why is it important to check the condition in a loop? Why does an if(…) statement not suffice?
#. The two principle approaches to avoid deadlock are (a) to reduce the possible lock combinations to a set that cannot produce a deadlock or (b) to ensure that acquiring multiple locks is an atomic operation. What are the advantages and disadvantages to each approach?
#. Given the code below: write the (pseudo-)code for (a) to reduce the possible lock combinations to a set that cannot produce a deadlock and (b) to ensure that acquiring multiple locks is an atomic operation


::

	typedef struct {
		int LockNumber;
		void* LockObject;
	} lock;

	void multi_lock(lock* locks, int lockCount) {
		... your code goes here ... 
	}


#. Rewrite the following code to avoid starvation:


::

	Queue _queue = new Queue();
	Mutex _lock = new Mutex();

	void produce() {
		while(1) {
			_lock->Lock();
			int item;
			scanf("%d\n", &item);
			_queue->Enqueue(item);
			_lock->Unlock();
		}
	}

	void consume() {
		while(1) {
			_lock->Lock();
			if(queue->Size() > 0) {
				int item = queue->Dequeue();
				printf("item: %d\n", item);
			}
			_lock->Unlock();
		}
	}


#. Do fairer locks increase or decrease resource (CPU or otherwise) utilization? Explain why or provide an example.
